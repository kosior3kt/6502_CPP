This Project is my interpretation of how does 6502 work.
It comes with no guarantee and stuff like that 
However feel free to tinker with it. I may even create assembly for it one day.
U need to have GTest and CMake istalled to run it 

List of what works (instruction wise):
    -LDA
    -LDX
    -LDY
    -JSR
    -INC
    -INX
    -INY
    -DEC
    -DEY
    -DEX
    -STA
    -STX
    -STY
    -RTS


Well, just do you know, for now all the addressing things will just have seperate functions. I realise it's stupid, but for now it will stay.
I kinda believe it will be usefull in the future when I will make a lib out of this thing and connect dedicated asm to it
